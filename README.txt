---------X-RAY DIFFRACTION ANALYSIS---------

    -A university assignment

    -Abstract:

    The aim of this paper is to explore x-ray diffraction and absorption patterns,
    highlighting the information they provide and to examine the limitations of modern x-ray equipment 
    using a variety of experimental methods.
    Four key results were recorded: The lattice constants of NaCl and Si; 2.834 ± 0.006A ̊ 
    and 5.425 ± 0.009A ̊ respectively, a value of the Rydberg constant; 13, 468, 900 ± 618600m−1 
    and a value of Planck’s constant; 6.30 × 10−34 ± 1.4 × 10−35m2kgs−1. 
    Through the analysis of such results it was found that throughout calculations, 
    important elements of theory were unaccounted for.
